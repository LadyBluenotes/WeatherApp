## General Information

This project was inspired by a tutorial done by Tyler Potts. Information for the tutorials are found here:

## Optimizations

In this project, an optimization that could be met is smoothing the transition between photos and making sure the photos are optimized for all screen sizes. In addition, adding some details could improve the user experience. For example, adding the ability to choose the town and country can be important as, at the moment, the application just picks the first one available. Another improvement could be the option to have suggestions. Much like the example before, it would allow users to pick the town they wish to see the temprature of.

## Lessons Learned

Throughout this project I learned more solidly about how to use React and JavaScript to create a function application that behaves well and respects the need for separation of concerns.

## Technologies

In addition to script written with JavaScript, React was used as the front-end framework. 

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

The API used can be found [here](https://openweathermap.org/api).
